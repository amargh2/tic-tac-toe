# tic-tac-toe
tic-tac-toe game

This is a project with a focus on the module pattern as well as objects/classes, etc with Tic-Tac-Toe. For now, the focus is on creating a simple two player (read: two humans!) game. Eventually, the computer will be able to play against a single player. The focus is currently on getting the interface and win evaluation working.

Each square has an x/o button, and the board updates appropriately with each click.
